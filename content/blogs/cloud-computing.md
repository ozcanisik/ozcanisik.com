## What is Cloud Computing Technology?

Cloud computing technology, also known as Cloud Computing, is the collective term for information processing services provided over the internet. These services are used to meet users' needs for storing, analyzing, and managing data. With this technology, users can access services over the internet without the need for installation on their computers or other devices.

Cloud computing services can be offered in various service categories, including Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). SaaS provides users with an application or service, while PaaS offers developers a software platform. IaaS provides basic infrastructure components such as virtual servers, storage space, and network components.

Cloud computing technology facilitates users' access to their data while outsourcing maintenance, backup, and security concerns to service providers. Additionally, users can determine their capacity and resource needs flexibly and pay based on their usage of the services. This way, both large and small businesses can more easily meet their IT requirements. Cloud computing has gained significant attention in recent years and is widely used by businesses and consumers.

### History of Cloud Computing Technology

Cloud computing technology provides information storage, processing, and sharing services over the internet. The concept of cloud computing was initially introduced by JCR Licklider in the 1960s with the idea of an "Interconnected Computer Network."

In the 1970s, the first internet technologies like ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) emerged. These networks provided information sharing and processing services. However, until the early 1990s, there was no widely available cloud computing service for the general public.

In the mid-1990s, internet technologies rapidly advanced, leading to more widespread information storage and sharing services. During this period, companies called "Application Service Providers (ASPs)" started delivering computing services over the internet.

In the early 2000s, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce began offering cloud computing services. These services enabled users to access storage, processing, and sharing services over the internet. During this time, the benefits of cloud computing services became clearer, and the adoption of these services by businesses increased.

Today, many companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc., provide cloud computing services. These services help reduce the computational burden in users' businesses, lower costs, and offer scalable and flexible computing infrastructure.
